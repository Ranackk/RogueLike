	> Add several room types, make a random world generation out of it
	> Add camera shake on damage, based on trauma formular (trauma += dmg - time, shake = pow(trauma, 2))
	> let the last heart blink 
	> custom models & shjader for player, enemies & bullets
	
	Unsure:
	
	> player death?
	> basic power ups? (damage, speed, movespeed?)


	Furhter Ideas for the Engine & Game:

	> Font Atlas Loader
	> Cache Line Optimization via using Systems (or at least trying for some things, maybe collision should be like it is)
		> Rendering & Input should be Systems
		> NEVERMIND: Just use an array with a set size for all static render elements (always rooms*roomX*roomY). Linear memory layout! 

	> Fix non instanced objects not rendering to shadow maps
	> Add Healthbars
	> Add items that amplify the projectiles
	> Add some kind of screen space transitions / effects on certain actions (requires additional fbo)

	Optimization:
	> Use Geometry shader to redner shadow cube map in one x draw calls instead of six x draw calls

	OR:
	> Use frustum culing for rendering (makes geometry shader approach useless)
	======

	> Store lighting in rooms via special color channel? (find a way to represent lighting, e.g. voxel torches)
	> Add enenmies with hp bars (using custom cutoff shader)
	
	Juicyness;
	Fade i out
	Camera shake ono dmg
	Camerafahrt at game start over the random dugeon (across, like in mario kart)
	

	======

	Redo for next game:
	> World with non fixed sized rooms (each field & enemy needs to know its room ID then)

	======

	Planning:
	> Create small game rogue like game with a random world generator
	> Add custom distance base lighting (only light directly around you)
	> Add custom shader effects for things such as transitions 

	> Enemy death -> Either plops into its voxels or drops the voxels
	> Use the voxels to craft your own weapons, voxel per voxel.
	> To make the rendering less expensive, consider using froms/blueprints which have a premade mesh and just change colors on demand based on the gems/voxels/pixels used
	> Could add some mining elements like in the old lego games


	====

	3D Models need to be triangulated
	They are currently VBO Indexed & use Instancing













	Performance Monitor:

	11.4ms w/ unbind shader programm
	4.99ms w/o unbind shader programm
	4.8 ms w/o unbind, w/o bind every frame

	Enter Instancing:
	1.7ms  w/ unbind shader programm
	> binding / undbinding doesnt make a difference as it is not the bottleneck anymore
	
	Planned optimization:
	? Save for each object a room id (if i want hide / unhide)
	> Make sure fields are accesible by xz koordinate but rendered by batch
